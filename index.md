### **Why a New Credit Score**<br>

A credit score is a numerical rating that represents the perceived ability of a person or organization to fulfill their financial commitments. The current scoring system in place is one that has been established and in use for a great number of years now, without many changes. Many new systems and additional data on financial behavior are now in place that allow for greater granularity of a consumer's overall financial behavior even without a credit score. The current credit scoring system today primarily relies on a consumer's previous credit history, leaving those that are just starting out with little to no credit history to be unable to qualify for any loans. With the rise of banking transactions and the use of personal transaction accounts, we aim to use this data to further extrapolate a consumer's behavior.

<br><br>

### **Introduction**<br>

Throughout this two-quarter long project, we aim to create a system that encapsulates all user behavior in a credit score using the provided banking transactions from Prism Data. Working alongside Prism Data, we build off of current methods they have in place and utilize abstract methods that one would consider "outside the box". By using new ideas that may not have been addressed before, this would benefit our overall analysis and predictive ability on a consumer's financial behavior.

### **Data**<br>

Our dataset is obtained from our industry partner, Prism Data. Prism data has given us samples of consumer inflow, outflow, consumer account data, along with credit application information to use for our analysis. All data has been omitted of personal identifiable information so no privacy is breached in our analysis and modeling.
